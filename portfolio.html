    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    <p>Lightbot is similar to a computer in the ways that it has certain functions that are made for it to complete specific tasks.<br>There are also many inputs for both Lightbot and a computer that if you undergo a specific input you will get an output out of it.<br>They are different by Lightbot being much simpler as far as the amount of controls there are compared to a computer. Also, Lightbot<br>is only programmed to complete one task while computers are to complete almost an infinite number of tasks of all kinds of topics.</p>

    <h3>Branching Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. It will take less time to figure out where your mistake was made if you make a mistake. By inserting it little by little<br>you can check if each piece is right.<br>2. It is similar to writing an essay because you have to go back and revise what you wrote to<br>get your point across.<br>4. A dual-core computer can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once by<br>running multiple programs at the same time. The CPU's don't run more than one line of a single program at once but can run<br>multiple programs at the same time. </p>

    <h3>Activity 1.1.4 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. You don't want a two diferent sprites doing the same thing if they aren't supposed to.<br>2. Events are th eactions that are happening when told to by the handlers which are the ones that tell the events what to do.<br>3a. It tells the events to do things like how much time to do a certain task or which task it should repeat.<br>3b. It would be good to know how long the tone is playing for if you didn't understand music that well and if you didn't know which instrument was added you would then know with the play G()</p>
