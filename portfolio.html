    <h3>Blown to Bits Reflection</h3>
    <p>I do agree that computing is vastly changing society. i believe that it is changing society to be pushed towards a more<br>technology relianced society. If you look around, alomst everyone has something in their lives that is computable. Although, the<br>advancement of technology can also lead to bad things, such as illegaly downloading movies or music. Companies unfortunately can't do<br>anything about it as the websites or apps that are used to download the content is set up to where they can't figure out how to prevent the illegal downloading. </p>
    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    <p>Lightbot is similar to a computer in the ways that it has certain functions that are made for it to complete specific tasks.<br>There are also many inputs for both Lightbot and a computer that if you undergo a specific input you will get an output out of it.<br>They are different by Lightbot being much simpler as far as the amount of controls there are compared to a computer. Also, Lightbot<br>is only programmed to complete one task while computers are to complete almost an infinite number of tasks of all kinds of topics.</p>

    <h3>Branching Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. It will take less time to figure out where your mistake was made if you make a mistake. By inserting it little by little<br>you can check if each piece is right.<br>2. It is similar to writing an essay because you have to go back and revise what you wrote to<br>get your point across.<br>4. A dual-core computer can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once by<br>running multiple programs at the same time. The CPU's don't run more than one line of a single program at once but can run<br>multiple programs at the same time. </p>

    <h3>Activity 1.1.4 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. You don't want a two diferent sprites doing the same thing if they aren't supposed to.<br>2. Events are th eactions that are happening when told to by the handlers which are the ones that tell the events what to do.<br>3a. It tells the events to do things like how much time to do a certain task or which task it should repeat.<br>3b. It would be good to know how long the tone is playing for if you didn't understand music that well and if you didn't know which instrument was added you would then know with the play G()</p>

    <h3>Activity 1.1.5 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. The primary advantage would be decreasing the level of complexity in the code that you're writing  which helps you find<br>an error that you may have made easier.<br>2. If y = 120 move sprite 1, if x = 120 move sprite 2.<br>3a. A fitbit or iHeart would have accumulators.<br>3b. A fitbit would have accumulators to track the number of steps that you take per day.<br>4. Accumulator is for mainly single roled things and an aggregator is a list of many things happening.</p>

    <h3>1.2.2 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. It is similar to scratch by the blocjs format as well as some of the commands that you<br>can insert. Also, the emulator relates to the little window in scratch<br>where you can preview the result of your code. In App Inventor it also shows the components and properties<br>of the components where you would hve to click "see inside" to view that on scrtach.<br>2. Mobile devices have already changed society by making complex taks much easier. For example, diving large numbers like 996,174 and 71 took a while before mobile devices as you now can go to your calculator app and type it in. People being able to program them is good for society as new versions and revisions can be made of the current version to improve the device. </p>
