    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    <p>Lightbot is similar to a computer in the ways that it has certain functions that are made for it to complete specific tasks.<br>There are also many inputs for both Lightbot and a computer that if you undergo a specific input you will get an output out of it.<br>They are different by Lightbot being much simpler as far as the amount of controls there are compared to a computer. Also, Lightbot<br>is only programmed to complete one task while computers are to complete almost an infinite number of tasks of all kinds of topics.</p>
