    <h3>Blown to Bits Reflection</h3>
    <p>I do agree that computing is vastly changing society. i believe that it is changing society to be pushed towards a more<br>technology relianced society. If you look around, alomst everyone has something in their lives that is computable. Although, the<br>advancement of technology can also lead to bad things, such as illegaly downloading movies or music. Companies unfortunately can't do<br>anything about it as the websites or apps that are used to download the content is set up to where they can't figure out how to prevent the illegal downloading. </p>
    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    <p>Lightbot is similar to a computer in the ways that it has certain functions that are made for it to complete specific tasks.<br>There are also many inputs for both Lightbot and a computer that if you undergo a specific input you will get an output out of it.<br>They are different by Lightbot being much simpler as far as the amount of controls there are compared to a computer. Also, Lightbot<br>is only programmed to complete one task while computers are to complete almost an infinite number of tasks of all kinds of topics.</p>

    <h3>Branching Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. It will take less time to figure out where your mistake was made if you make a mistake. By inserting it little by little<br>you can check if each piece is right.<br>2. It is similar to writing an essay because you have to go back and revise what you wrote to<br>get your point across.<br>4. A dual-core computer can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once by<br>running multiple programs at the same time. The CPU's don't run more than one line of a single program at once but can run<br>multiple programs at the same time. </p>

    <h3>Activity 1.1.4 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. You don't want a two diferent sprites doing the same thing if they aren't supposed to.<br>2. Events are th eactions that are happening when told to by the handlers which are the ones that tell the events what to do.<br>3a. It tells the events to do things like how much time to do a certain task or which task it should repeat.<br>3b. It would be good to know how long the tone is playing for if you didn't understand music that well and if you didn't know which instrument was added you would then know with the play G()</p>

    <h3>Activity 1.1.5 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. The primary advantage would be decreasing the level of complexity in the code that you're writing  which helps you find<br>an error that you may have made easier.<br>2. If y = 120 move sprite 1, if x = 120 move sprite 2.<br>3a. A fitbit or iHeart would have accumulators.<br>3b. A fitbit would have accumulators to track the number of steps that you take per day.<br>4. Accumulator is for mainly single roled things and an aggregator is a list of many things happening.</p>

    <h3>Game Description</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>1.2.2 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    <p>1. It is similar to scratch by the blocjs format as well as some of the commands that you<br>can insert. Also, the emulator relates to the little window in scratch<br>where you can preview the result of your code. In App Inventor it also shows the components and properties<br>of the components where you would hve to click "see inside" to view that on scrtach.<br>2. Mobile devices have already changed society by making complex taks much easier. For example,<br>diving large numbers like 996,174 and 71 took a while before mobile devices as you now can go to your calculator app and type it in. People being able to program them is good for society as new versions and revisions can be made of the current version to improve the device. </p>
	  <h3>1.2.3 Conclusion Questions</h3>
	  <p>1. The app inventor code is fairly similar to Scratch. They look similar as they both have<br>the blocks for code. They also differ by the app inventor not needing<br>a user interaction to begin a program and on Scratch you need to clickt he green flag.<br>2. Designing for a mobile phone is much different from designing for a computer because they both have different actions.<br>A mobile device can vibrate and reveal its position while a computer is unable to do that.</p>

	  <h3>1.3.3 Conclusion Questions</h3>
	  <p>1. The "if" block statement tells the computer if the input correlates with what's in the<br>code, then the output will be whatever is said to be in that statement.<br>An "elif" statement is used for the same purpose an "if" statemet, but it follows the "if" statement.<br>An else statement is for ny other input submitted by the user.<br>2. Boolean statement describes logical expressions that can result true or false.<br>An example would be 1 == 1 which is true or 1 != 0 which is also true.<br>3. I don't believe in Ira's statement and I believe Jayla has the best argument.<br>The programer needs to change tht line of code or else it will present problems down the road.</p>
	  <h3>1.3.4 Conclusion Questions</h3>
	  <p>1. In order to do glass box testing you must be able to see the code and if the statements<br>show the certain parts of the code being performed.<br>2. There are no parallel structures being executed because only one line of code is being ran.<br>3. Test suites work by runnning every line of code because it follows each path to make sure the program runs properly.</p>
	  <h3>1.3.8 Conclusion Questions</h3>
	  <p>1. Insertion is the best when sorting nearly sorted data because it is the fastest.<br>2. Merge sort takes the dame amont of time when sorting each of the data set.<br>3. To find their birthday, it would take a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 9.<br>4. The values will have a confict and will not display values like "lower" or "higher".<br>5. You know it's sorted because the index is easily searchable.</p>
	  <h3>1.3.10 Game Theory</h3>
	  <p>1. In a game of rock, paper, scissors, you make your next move based off of what your opponent<br>has been playing. For example, your opponent bets you with rock,<br>so you think he may play rock again. You can write code that takes into account<br>possibilities and plays accordingly.<br>2. Abstract is writing complex code in an easier way making it easier to understand. It is useful because there is soe code that is really long but can be shortened with abstraction.<br>3. The function "random" is an example of an abstraction. Instead of writing a super complex code on picking a random integer, you can just use the abstraction. </p>
	  <h3>1.4.2 Conclusion Questions</h3>
	  <p>1. Absolute file names are files outside of the program and relative files are within the program.<br>2. An object is a variable that has a certain class where all objects<br>have certin functions assigned to it.<br>3. Methods give instrucions for a certain objects and properties are a tyle of member of class.<br>4. The method will run the funtion when the object is called.</p>
	  <h3>1.4.3 Conclusion Questions</h3>
	  <p>1. The data in the image is made of many lists that tell the pixels what color to be on<br>the RGB scale.<br>2. Light sensitive film is stored by how good the actual film is, not the pixels.<br>3a. They are least significant because they are on the far right.<br>3b. 6 bits should be enough because the makeup goe 1,2,4,8,16,32 from first to last which adds up to 63.<br>4. It can complete this because it runs through the lists and determines which are pixels.</p>
